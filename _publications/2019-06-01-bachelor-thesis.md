This Bachelor's thesis explores the output shape of a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) used in jet assignment within the context of the `tH` (top-Higgs) production channel. The study was conducted as part of the CMS experiment at CERN and involves simulation-based performance evaluation of the BDT classifier.
